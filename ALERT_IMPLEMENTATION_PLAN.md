# KakaoTalk Alert Notification Feature: Implementation Plan (Finalized)

## 1. Feature Overview

When a user configures their alert settings (selecting categories of interest like "Regions" and "Support Fields"), the system should monitor for new government funding opportunities. If a new fund matches the user's selected categories, a KakaoTalk message containing the fund's title and a short description should be sent to the user.

**Status:** After comprehensive database analysis of the AI BIZPLAN project, we found several necessary tables already exist. The implementation will build on this foundation.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

*   **Backend Services (Existing & To Complete):**
    *   `governmentSupportService.ts` - Already handles fetching fund data
    *   `kakaoNotificationService.ts` - Has placeholder functions for notifications
    *   `userNotificationService.ts` - Handles user preferences for notifications
*   **Database (Supabase):**
    *   `user_notification_settings` - **EXISTING** (with kakao_token, regions, categories)
    *   `funding_opportunities` - **EXISTING** (storing government fund information)
    *   `sent_notifications` - **EXISTING** (tracking which notifications have been sent)
    *   `message_queue` - **EXISTING** (tracking message delivery status)
*   **Scheduled Task:** Implementation needed to trigger notification processing
*   **Frontend Enhancements:** Completing and refining existing UI

## 4. Dependencies and Task Order

```
Task 1 → Task 2 → Task 3 → Task 5
   ↓       ↓
Task 4 ----→----→ Task 6 → Task 7
                    ↑
Task 8 ------------→
   ↓
Task 9
```

This refined sequence ensures that:
1. We first understand the existing implementation (Task 1)
2. Database foundation is laid early (Task 2)
3. Core services are built in parallel where possible (Tasks 3, 4)
4. Integration and orchestration follow (Tasks 5, 6, 7)
5. UI enhancements can proceed in parallel (Task 8)
6. Testing is comprehensive and concludes the project (Task 9)

## 5. Implementation Notes

* The KakaoTalk token has a limited lifespan and may need refresh mechanisms
* Consider rate limits for both the funding opportunities API and Kakao API
* Performance considerations:
  * Batch processing for message queue
  * Limit number of notifications per user per day
  * Efficient matching algorithm to scale with user base
* Use transaction blocks for data consistency in multi-step operations
* The existing `user_notification_settings` table already has columns for `kakao_linked`, `kakao_token`, `regions`, and `categories` that can be used directly
