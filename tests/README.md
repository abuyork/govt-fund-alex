# KakaoTalk Alert Notification System - Testing Notes

This document provides information about the current state of testing for the KakaoTalk alert notification system.

## Current Test Status

### Working Tests
Currently, two test suites are working correctly:
- `notificationMatchingService.test.ts` (8 tests passing)
- `notificationGenerationService.test.ts` (10 tests passing)

To run these working tests:
```bash
npm run test:working
```

### Tests With Issues
The following tests still have TypeScript errors that need to be fixed:
- `notificationTaskService.test.ts` - Has type errors in the mock implementations
- `notificationFlow.test.ts` (integration test) - Has several type issues and mock implementation problems

## Key Issues to Fix

1. **TypeScript errors in mocks**:
   - Several mocks are not properly typed to match Supabase's expected response formats
   - Jest spyOn usage in integration tests is incorrect

2. **import.meta.env handling**:
   - Tests are struggling with the Vite-specific import.meta.env variables
   - Although we have set up a global mock in tests/setup.ts, it's not being properly recognized

3. **ESM vs CommonJS issues**:
   - We have two Jest configuration files (jest.config.js and jest.config.ts)
   - There are module format conflicts because package.json has "type": "module"

## Next Steps

1. Fix the TypeScript errors in the notificationTaskService.test.ts file
2. Fix the integration test TypeScript errors
3. Complete the remaining tests for notificationTaskProcessor.ts and notificationOrchestrator.ts
4. Reenable test coverage thresholds once all tests are working

## Current Test Coverage

The current test coverage for the working tests is:
- notificationGenerationService.ts: 91.86% 
- notificationMatchingService.ts: 68.26%
- Other services: not yet tested

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (will show errors for some tests)
npm test

# Run only working tests
npm run test:working

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run notification tests specifically
npm run test:notification
```
