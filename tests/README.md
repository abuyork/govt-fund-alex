# KakaoTalk Alert Notification System - Testing Notes

This document provides information about the current state of testing for the KakaoTalk alert notification system.

## Current Test Status

### Working Tests
We now have four test suites working correctly:
- `notificationMatchingService.test.ts` (8 tests passing)
- `notificationGenerationService.test.ts` (10 tests passing)
- `notificationTaskService.test.ts` (12 tests passing)
- `notificationFlow.test.ts` (1 integration test passing)

To run these working tests:
```bash
npm test -- --config=jest.config.ts tests/unit/notificationGenerationService.test.ts tests/unit/notificationMatchingService.test.ts tests/unit/notificationTaskService.test.ts tests/integration/notificationFlow.test.ts
```

### Current Test Coverage

The current test coverage for the working tests is:
- notificationGenerationService.ts: 91.46% statements
- notificationMatchingService.ts: 67.34% statements
- notificationTaskService.ts: 48.57% statements
- Integration tests: Cover the core flows but with mocked services

### Remaining Tests To Implement
- `notificationOrchestrator.ts` - No test coverage yet
- `notificationTaskProcessor.ts` - No test coverage yet
- `kakaoNotificationService.ts` - No test coverage yet (services that use import.meta.env are problematic for direct testing)

## Implementation Notes

### Handling import.meta.env in Tests
To work around the issue of import.meta.env not being supported in Jest, we've implemented two strategies:

1. **For integration tests**: We completely mock the services that use import.meta.env rather than trying to test them directly
2. **For standalone services**: We could create mock versions of the services that don't use import.meta.env for testing purposes

### Mock Implementations
- Created type-compliant mocks using the `jest.fn()` pattern
- Implemented proper mock helpers in `tests/unit/mocks/supabaseMock.ts` to standardize Supabase response formats
- Used TypeScript type assertions to enforce proper typing on mocks

## Issues Resolved

1. **TypeScript errors in mocks**:
   - Fixed improper mock implementations to match Supabase's expected response formats
   - Corrected how we mock chained method calls for Supabase queries
   - Added type assertions where needed to satisfy TypeScript

2. **import.meta.env handling**:
   - Created complete mocks for services that rely on import.meta.env
   - Updated Jest configuration in jest.config.ts to use a custom tsconfig (tsconfig.jest.json)

3. **Mock implementations**:
   - Created reusable helpers in supabaseMock.ts for consistent response formats
   - Properly configured mock implementations for services

## Next Steps

1. **Increase code coverage**: Target at least 70% coverage for all key services
2. **Implement missing tests**:
   - Create tests for the notification orchestrator
   - Create tests for the notification task processor
   - Consider how to best test the Kakao notification service
3. **Create standardized mocks**: Continue refining the mock implementations to make them more reusable
4. **Add tests to package.json**: Add a specific script to run all working tests

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run working tests with specific configuration
npm test -- --config=jest.config.ts tests/unit/notificationGenerationService.test.ts tests/unit/notificationMatchingService.test.ts tests/unit/notificationTaskService.test.ts tests/integration/notificationFlow.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
